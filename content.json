      "html": "<p>Collection, curation and annotation of data is a tedious endeavour. The challenges in this arena are two-fold: (1) To build, maintain and manage teams or crowds of skilled data-workers, allocating them a steady supply of skill-appropriate tasks, maintaining quality control and motivation. (2) To build a toolkit that enables automation of those data tasks that can be automated. This includes domain-specific and domain-agnostic tools such as data scrapers, format convertors, annotation tools, etc. There is ample scope for developing several novel machine learning based methods for such automation.</p><p>Automation requires the data to be validated subsequently with manual expert or non-expert help. To make the data usable, it often needs to be annotated using the vocabulary and practices of the underlying domain. This requires significant time of appropriate experts, by itself a difficult and costly task.</p><p>It is reasonably obvious that the process of creating and collating data is time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. For managing teams of data-workers, a project management platform built for such purposes needs to be built and/or deployed. The Data Foundation has its target the creation of 20-25 high-impact data sets in varied domains, by employing a team of data workers for transcription, curation, annotation, etc.</p>",
